How to test:

FOR VSCODE
1.) Open a VSCode terminal and make sure you have the packages react, node, bootstrap, and gh-pages installed.
2.) Run the commands 
npm run build
 and then 
npm run deploy
 in a VSCode terminal BEFORE you view the website. Refresh the website until you see the changes.

 FOR A DIFFERENT IDE
 1.) Open a terminal
 2.) Build the project
 3.) Run the IDE's native localhost command
 4.) Refresh the pages until the changes take effect.

 FOR GITHUB
 ***NOTE: The final website will be stored on the gh-pages branch of our project. *This branch should not be updated until we finalize our changes in main.*
 1.) Update working with changes.
 2.) Copy working to main.
 3.) Copy main to gh-pages.
 4.) Go to https://questlinedj.github.io/task-knight/ and refresh the page until your changes appear.
